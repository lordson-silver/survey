      Thank you for agreeing to complete this survey that will enable us to
      determine your eligibility in a research study we are conducting.
      Remember, we are not trying to sell you anything, and we will keep your
      identity completely confidential. It is very important that you answer the
      questions that follow as correctly and truthfully as you can. Based upon
      your answers, you may qualify for this study. If you do qualify for this
      study, we will assume that your answers are valid and will expect your
      responses to the actual study to match how you have responded in this
      survey. If they do not, we will withhold your incentive and you will have
      wasted your time and ours. Last, we may ask for your contact information,
      but it will only be used in order to provide you with more information
      about the study and to coordinate with your schedule.
